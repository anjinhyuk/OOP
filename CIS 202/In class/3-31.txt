It's the rule
when you implement an interface, you agree to include ALL methods
defined by that interface.

1. JApplet has NO methods for handling key strows
2. But KeyListener does!
3. Make your applet class implement Key listener
4. Add all methods from interface into your class
5. addKeyListener(this) to init method
6. requestfocusinWindow() in paint

What Choices can take place at compile-time?
Waht choives must wait until run-time?

BINDING
object -> method

STATIC BINDING : When the method to call is determined at compile time FASTER!
DYNAMIC BINDING : When the method to call is determined at run-time
