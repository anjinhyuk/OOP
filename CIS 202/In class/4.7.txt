4.7

final fields (ie. constants)
usually should be SHARED
across all objects of a class.


STATIC FIELDS (and methods)
Belong to the class
Not to the Object


<THEORY>
- OBJECTS KNOW ABOUT THEIR CLASS
- THE CLASS DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT INDIVIDUAL OBJECT


<PRACTICE>
- Static methods cannot access non-static fields
- Static methods cannot call other non-static
  methods in their class

-variable
public : available everywhere
static : shared 
final : cannot be changed

BOOLEAN OPERATOR 
num == num (!=, <, >, <=, >=)

object instanceof class name
-> 99% of time, use subclasses and overriden methods instead of instanceof
*FINAL 
Static methods
int x;
p.static void foo() {
x++; }

ans : this is an error
